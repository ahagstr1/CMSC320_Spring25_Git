Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git is good for version control, collaboration, backup, branching 
and merging, and it is widely used so there's a lot of documentation.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: Data science can be applied to management consulting to help 
businesses make data-driven decisions, optimize operations, and improve 
performance. For example, a consulting firm working with a retail company can
use data science to analyze customer purchasing patterns. By leveraging ML
models and predictive analysis, they can identify trends and segment customers
to give the retail company specific steps to implement personalized marketing
strategies.


Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?

Answer: Merging and rebasing are both ways to integrate changes from a branch.
Merging combines the histories of two branches without altering their 
commit history and creates a new merge commit to tie the branches. This keeps
track of when branches are merged. Rebasing movies and replays commits 
from one branch into another to make a linear commit history. There is no
extra merge commit. This makes the history cleaner and more linnear but
rewrites the commit history which is bad in some cases. 


Q4: What are you looking forward to this semester?

Answer: This semester I look forward to making the most out of my classes.
I've gotten to the point where I can choose my computer science classes
which is really fun! I also look forward to spending more time with friends!
